# Window With A Header Bar

> The source code for this chapter can be found [here](https://github.com/mmstick/gtkrs-tutorials/tree/master/demos/chapter_01).

In this chapter, we will create a simple GTK application that features a header bar. This will
serve as an introduction to the basics of creating a GTK application data structure to contain
the widgets that you will later program, as well as spawning a GTK window and running your
application.

> Before continuing, do ensure that you have added the **gtk** crate to your **Cargo.toml** file,
> and additionally have specified at least `v3_14` as a feature to enable with the **gtk** crate.

## Creating the GTK Application Structures

The following diagram lays out how we will construct our GTK application data structure. One does
not have to follow this diagram to achieve the same result, but structuring your UI struct into a
hierarchy of partitions can be helpful to the mind.

<img src="images/ch1_diagram.png" />

As we can see, we will need to create a structure that has a **GtkWindow** and a **Header**.

```rust
extern crate gtk;
use gtk::*;
use std::process;

pub struct App {
    pub window: Window,
    pub header: Header,
}
```

The **Header** is another structure that we will create, which will contain the **GtkHeaderbar** and
all of the widgets within that header bar.

```rust
pub struct Header {
    pub container: HeaderBar
}
```

## Creating the UI with Rust

Next is to generate our UI with Rust, and store it in the newly-defined structures.

First is the **App** structure, which will be contain the overall structure of our UI in a
well-defined hierarchy of data structures and associated data. The following code example
provides in-line comments to describe each of the methods that are being used to configure it.

We will be creating the **GtkWindow** that we will attach every UI element to, the **Header**
structure that will contain our **GtkHeaderBar**, and programming the exit function within the
window. It's also important that we set a title for the window, the **wmclass** which will be
seen by window managers, and setting the icon to display within the window manager via the
`Window::set_default_icon_name()` function.

```rust
impl App {
    fn new() -> App {
        // Create a new top level window.
        let window = Window::new(WindowType::Toplevel);
        // Create a the headerbar and it's associated content.
        let header = Header::new();

        // Set the headerbar as the title bar widget.
        window.set_titlebar(&header.container);
        // Set the title of the window.
        window.set_title("App Name");
        // Set the window manager class.
        window.set_wmclass("app-name", "App name");
        // The icon the app will display.
        Window::set_default_icon_name("iconname");

        // Programs what to do when the exit button is used.
        window.connect_delete_event(move |_, _| {
            main_quit();
            Inhibit(false)
        });

        // Return our main application state
        App { window, header }
    }
}
```

And then there is our **Header** structure, which for now, will only contain the **GtkHeaderBar**.
It is important to set the title of this header bar, if you want a title to be displayed, and to
also enable window controls on it, as this is disabled by default.

```rust
impl Header {
    fn new() -> Header {
        // Creates the main header bar container widget.
        let container = HeaderBar::new();

        // Sets the text to display in the title section of the header bar.
        container.set_title("App Name");
        // Enable the window controls within this headerbar.
        container.set_show_close_button(true);

        // Returns the header and all of it's state
        Header { container }
    }
}
```

## Initializing and Launching the Application

Now that we are ready, we simply need to initialize GTK, create our GTK application structure,
show all of the widgets within that structure, and start the GTK main event loop.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Initialize GTK before proceeding.
    if gtk::init().is_err() {
        eprintln!("failed to initialize GTK Application");
        process::exit(1);
    }

    // Initialize the UI's initial state
    let app = App::new();

    // Make all the widgets within the UI visible.
    app.window.show_all();

    // Start the GTK main event loop
    gtk::main();
}
```

Once the main thread has entered the event loop, it will poll across each of the widgets for
actions that have been triggered, such as the `connect_delete_event()` method that we used
above to program the exit button to exit the program.

## The Result

With all of this complete, you should now have a program up and running that looks like so.
