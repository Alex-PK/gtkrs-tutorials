# Boxes, Buttons, & Labels

This section will give look into how to structure your UI with boxes, manipulate labels,
and programming clicked buttons with closures. By the end, you will also have an understanding
of how to add children to a header bar, add style classes to buttons, manage application state
via **Arc**'d atomic components, and align widgets within a container.

> Recall that each GTK object that you obtain from the **gtk** crates are wrapped so that you
> need not worry about Rust borrowing rules. GTK objects are reference-counted, so when you need
> to share a GTK object across multiple closures, you can do so by simply cloning a new
> reference.

## Prerequisites

It is generally assumed that you have an understanding of atomics and atomic reference
counters (**Arc**) before continuing with this tutorial. In order to share state across multiple
programmable closures, or even multiple threads, it is vital to take advantage of these concepts.
See the **std::sync** and **std::sync::atomic** modules to learn about them beforehand. You can
also checkout [this paper on lockless concurrency](https://assets.bitbashing.io/papers/lockless.pdf).
