# GTK Rust Tutorials

To get started, first install Rust/Cargo, as well as GTK development libraries. Then, obtain
mdbook from cargo with `cargo install mdbook`, and you can build/host this documentation on
your system with `mdbook serve`, which can be accessed by your web browser on port 3000, by
default.

> Note that accompanying source code for each chapter can be found in the demos directory.
